Have a form so users can add/edit players. The form must include the following three fields: firstName:String, lastName:String, score:Integer[0,100]
Display the leaderboard in a tabular format sorted by score, and lastName in ASCENDING order. Therefore, if two players have the same score, the sorting will fall back to lastName
The names displayed on the leaderboard should be combined into one field when displaying as such: lastName, firstName
Have the ability to remove players by clicking a Delete button in the leaderboard.
